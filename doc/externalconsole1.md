[Auth Credentials](#auth-credentials) | 0 | 0 | ✔ | 
[Auth](#auth) | 1 | 1 |  | ✔
[Welcome](#welcome) | 2 | 2 | ✔ | 

#### Auth Credentials

Credentials for login.

 | | | 
---|---|---
protocol | ubyte | Protocol used by the server. If the client uses a different one it should close the connection without sending any packet.

hashAlgorithm | string | Algorithm used by the server to match the the hash. If empty no hashing is done and the password is sent raw.

payload | ubyte[16] | Payload to add to the password encoded as UTF-8 (if hashAlgorithm is not empty) before hashing it.

[Console Message](#console-message) | 3 | 3 | ✔ | 
[Command](#command) | 4 | 4 |  | 
[Permission Denied](#permission-denied) | 5 | 5 | ✔ | 

#### Console Message

Logs a message from the server's console. It may be a result of a command, a debug message or any other message that the server retains able to be seen by the External Console.

 | | | 
---|---|---
node | string | Name of the node that has created the log or an empty string if the log has been created by the hub or by a server implementation that isn&apos;t based on the hub-node structure.

timestamp | ulong | Unix timestamp in milliseconds that indicates the exact time when the log has been generated by the server.

logger | string | Name of the logger. It is the world name if the log has been generated by a world&apos;s message (like a broadcast or a chat message).

message | string | The logged message. It may contain Minecraft&apos;s formatting codes which should be translated into appropriate colours by the client-side implementation.

#### Command

Executes a command remotely if the server allows it. If not a [Permission Denied](#permission-denied) is sent back. The ideal client should never send this packet if remoteCommands field in [Welcome.Accepted](#accepted) is not true.

 | | | 
---|---|---
command | string | Command to be executed on the server. On SEL servers it should start with a slash or a point (hub command) or a node name followed by the command (node command).

#### Permission Denied

Bodyless packet only sent in response to [Command](#command) when the server doesn't allow the execution of remote commands through the External Console protocol. The ideal client should never receive this packet avoiding the use of [Command](#command) if the remoteCommands field in [Welcome.Accepted](#accepted) is not true.
